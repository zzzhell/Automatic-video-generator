# Automatic-video-generator

This project automatically generates a video with music and synthetic voiceover. Using three sets of input search terms, the program extracts, analyzes, edits and combines videos, voiceover texts and music from the Internet Archive and KHInsider.

The output_examples folder contains output video examples. The files are named after the search terms in the following format: 'video_search_phrase-voiceover_keyword-soundtrack_keyword'.

The corpus for the voiceover text search can be downloaded here: https://rismc.blob.core.windows.net/rismc/sentences.pickle
